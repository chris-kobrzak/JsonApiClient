# JwtApiClient

Low-level utilities for interacting with APIs using [JWToken](https://jwt.io) authentication and transferring data in the JSON format.

## Requirements

- iOS 15+ as the code uses the `async/await` syntax.

## Credits

The code is based on an [article by Donny
Wals](https://www.donnywals.com/building-a-token-refresh-flow-with-async-await-and-swift-concurrency/)
covering concurrency in the latest version of the [Swift programming
language](https://swift.org).
